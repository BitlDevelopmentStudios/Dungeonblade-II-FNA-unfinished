# DUNGEONBLADE II (working title)
A text adventure built with GrobEngine, a in-house, open source, FNA powered framework. This framework is built specifically with the focus of giving modders full access to the game's code. The engine is included here as a git submodule.

This version of the game was originally meant to be a text adventure, but there would be visible paths viewed with a seperate window. Due to issues regarding FNA (FNA wasn't built for text adventures in mind) and other technical issues, the DungeonEngine was made: https://github.com/BitlDevelopmentStudios/DungeonEngine
