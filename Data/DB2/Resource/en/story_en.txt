You are %name%.

It has been 8 months since the downfall of the Living Dungeon.
The king has gifted you the Dungeonblade, the most powerful sword in the kingdom.
Despite your newfound weapon, there hasn't been any reason to use it.
Peace has been restored, or so it would seem.

The king has assured you that because of your actions, the kingdom is safe from any future attacks.
As you wield the Dungeonblade, the supernatural will never attack the kingdom.
He has said this numerous times. You know in your heart that the battle is not over.
It may just be paranoia speaking, but you knew they will come back.

Today is that day.
